# App Store Connect Setup - Bundle ID & App Registration

## üéØ The Problem

Your bundle ID doesn't appear in App Store Connect because you need to:
1. Register the Bundle ID in Apple Developer Portal first
2. Then create the app in App Store Connect

---

## üìç Step 1: Register Bundle ID (Apple Developer Portal)

### Go to Apple Developer Portal:

1. Open: https://developer.apple.com/account
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Click **"Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"**

### Create App ID (Bundle ID):

1. Click **"Identifiers"** in the sidebar
2. Click the **"+"** button (top left, near "Identifiers")
3. Select **"App IDs"** ‚Üí Click **Continue**
4. Select **"App"** ‚Üí Click **Continue**

### Configure App ID:

**Bundle ID:**
- Select: **Explicit**
- Enter: `com.swiezy.protech` (or your preferred bundle ID)
  - Format: `com.yourcompany.appname`
  - Must be unique
  - Cannot be changed later
  - Use lowercase, no spaces
  - Examples:
    - `com.swiezy.protech`

## üìç Step 2: Update Xcode with Your Bundle ID

### In Xcode:

1. Select **ProTech** project (blue icon at top of navigator)
2. Select **ProTech** target (under TARGETS)
3. Click **Signing & Capabilities** tab

### Update Bundle Identifier:

**Find "Bundle Identifier" field:**
- Current value: probably `com.yourcompany.ProTech` or similar
- Change to: `com.swiezy.protech` (match what you registered)

**Team:**
- Select your Apple Developer team from dropdown
- If you don't see your team:
  - Xcode ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Accounts
  - Add your Apple ID
  - Download Manual Profiles

**Signing Certificate:**

## üìç Step 3: Update Configuration.swift

Change:
```swift
// In-App Purchase Product IDs
static let monthlySubscriptionID = "com.yourcompany.techstorepro.monthly"
static let annualSubscriptionID = "com.yourcompany.techstorepro.annual"
```

To match your new bundle ID:
```swift
// In-App Purchase Product IDs
static let monthlySubscriptionID = "com.swiezy.protech.monthly"
static let annualSubscriptionID = "com.swiezy.protech.annual"
```

**Important:** 
- Product IDs should start with your bundle ID
- Add `.monthly` or `.annual` at the end
- These will be used when creating in-app purchases

Simple, clear, and follows Apple conventions!
