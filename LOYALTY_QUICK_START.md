Points per Dollar: 0.5

Result: Lower point liability, slower accumulation
```

**Moderate (Standard):**
```
Points per Dollar: 1.0
Visit Bonus: 10
Reward Cost: Medium (e.g., 250 pts for $10 off)
Result: Balanced engagement and costs
```

**Aggressive (Growth Mode):**
```
Points per Dollar: 2.0
Visit Bonus: 25
Reward Cost: Low (e.g., 150 pts for $10 off)
Result: Fast accumulation, high redemption, max engagement
```

### Staff Training:

1. **Always mention loyalty** during checkout
2. **Enroll proactively** - "Would you like to join our rewards?"
3. **Check for rewards** before finalizing payment
4. **Celebrate milestones** - "You just reached Silver tier!"
5. **Promote next reward** - "Only 50 more points for $10 off!"

### Marketing:
