4. **Network issue** - Check internet connection

**Solutions:**
- Copy token again carefully (no spaces)
- Match environment to token type
- Generate a new token
- Test with sandbox first

### "Connection successful" but sync still fails

**Check these:**
1. Location ID is set (should auto-populate)
2. Token has correct permissions (ITEMS_READ, ITEMS_WRITE, INVENTORY_READ, INVENTORY_WRITE)
3. Try "Test Connection" again

### Permissions Errors

If you see permission-related errors:

1. Go to Square Developer Dashboard
2. Select your app
3. Go to **"OAuth"** tab
4. Ensure these permissions are enabled:
   - ‚úÖ Items Read
   - ‚úÖ Items Write
   - ‚úÖ Inventory Read
   - ‚úÖ Inventory Write
   - ‚úÖ Merchant Profile Read

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need a paid Square account?**  
A: No! You can use a free Square developer account with sandbox credentials for testing. For production sync with real data, you need an active Square seller account.

**Q: Will this delete my existing inventory?**  
A: No. Sync operations:
- **Import** - Adds items, doesn't delete
- **Export** - Adds items, doesn't delete
- **Sync** - Updates existing, adds new, based on your conflict strategy

**Q: Can I undo a sync?**  
A: Not automatically. Always backup before major syncs.

**Q: How often should I sync?**  
A: 
- Auto-sync: Every 30-60 minutes
- Manual: After bulk changes
- Real-time: Enable webhooks (advanced)

**Q: What if I have items in both systems with same name?**  
A: The system matches by SKU first, then creates mapping. Items with same name but different SKUs are treated as separate items.

**Q: Can I sync only some items?**  
A: Currently, sync operations are all-or-nothing. Category/filtered sync is planned for future release.
