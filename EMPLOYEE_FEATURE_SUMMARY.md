## üö¶ Integration Steps

### 1. Add Core Data Entities (Required)

**Employee Entity:**
```
id, firstName, lastName, email, phone, role, pinCode, passwordHash,
hourlyRate, isActive, isAdmin, employeeNumber, hireDate, lastLoginAt,
profileImageData, createdAt, updatedAt
```

**TimeClockEntry Entity:**
```
id, employeeId, clockInTime, clockOutTime, breakStartTime, breakEndTime,
totalBreakDuration, totalHours, notes, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt
```

### 2. Update CoreDataManager
```swift
Employee.entityDescription(),
TimeClockEntry.entityDescription(),
```

### 3. Update Main App
```swift
@StateObject private var authService = AuthenticationService.shared

var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
        if authService.isAuthenticated {
            MainContentView()
        } else {
            LoginView()
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Add Navigation
```swift
// Employee Management (Admin only)
if authService.hasPermission(.manageEmployees) {
    NavigationLink(destination: EmployeeManagementView()) {
        Label("Employees", systemImage: "person.3")
    }
}

// Time Clock (All employees)
NavigationLink(destination: TimeClockView()) {
    Label("Time Clock", systemImage: "clock.fill")
}
```

- Repair tickets linked to the customer are now listed on the customer detail view for quick access to active and past jobs

These improvements keep customer, employee, and scheduling workflows aligned without manual cleanup.

### Login
```swift
// PIN Login
authService.loginWithPIN("1234")

// Password Login
authService.loginWithEmail("user@example.com", password: "pass123")
```

### Check Permissions
```swift
if authService.hasPermission(.manageEmployees) {
    // Show employee management
}
```

### Time Clock
```swift
// Clock in
try timeClockService.clockIn(employeeId: employeeId)

// Start/end break
try timeClockService.startBreak(employeeId: employeeId)
try timeClockService.endBreak(employeeId: employeeId)
