## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Low Stock Alerts Not Showing
**Solution:** Ensure `minQuantity` is set correctly for each item. Items with `quantity <= minQuantity` trigger alerts.

### Stock Adjustment Not Saving
**Solution:** Check that `InventoryService.shared.adjustStock()` is being called with valid parameters and item exists.

### Purchase Order Not Updating Inventory
**Solution:** Verify `receivePurchaseOrder()` is called with correct item IDs matching inventory.

### Search Not Finding Items
**Solution:** Search matches name, partNumber, and SKU fields. Ensure these are populated.
