## üîí Security

### What's Secure

‚úÖ **Card numbers are NEVER stored in your database**
- Stripe handles all sensitive card data
- You only store card last 4 digits and brand
- PCI compliance handled by Stripe

‚úÖ **API keys stored securely**
- Production: Use Keychain for API key storage
- Never log or display API keys
- Separate test and live keys

‚úÖ **HTTPS required**
- All Stripe API calls use HTTPS
- Encrypted data transmission

### Best Practices

1. **Use Test Mode First**
   - Always test with test API keys
   - Use test card numbers from Stripe docs
   
2. **Never Log Sensitive Data**
   - Don't log full card numbers
   - Don't log CVV codes
   - Don't log API keys
   
3. **Validate on Server**
   - In production, validate amounts server-side
   - Prevent amount tampering
   
4. **Monitor Transactions**
   - Check Stripe dashboard regularly
   - Set up fraud alerts
   - Review refund patterns
