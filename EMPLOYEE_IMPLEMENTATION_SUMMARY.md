## üöÄ Integration Steps

### 1. Add Core Data Entities (Required)

Open Xcode and add these entities to your Core Data model:

**Employee Entity:**
```
id: UUID (primary, indexed)
firstName: String
lastName: String
email: String (unique, indexed)
phone: String (optional)
role: String
pinCode: String (optional)
passwordHash: String (optional)
hourlyRate: Decimal
isActive: Boolean (default: true)
isAdmin: Boolean (default: false)
employeeNumber: String
hireDate: Date
lastLoginAt: Date (optional)
profileImageData: Binary (optional)
createdAt: Date
updatedAt: Date
```

**TimeClockEntry Entity:**
```
id: UUID (primary, indexed)
employeeId: UUID (indexed)
clockInTime: Date
clockOutTime: Date (optional)
breakStartTime: Date (optional)
breakEndTime: Date (optional)
totalBreakDuration: Double (default: 0)
totalHours: Double (default: 0)
notes: String (optional)
isActive: Boolean (default: true)
createdAt: Date
updatedAt: Date
```

### 2. Update CoreDataManager

Add to entity list in `CoreDataManager.swift`:

```swift
Employee.entityDescription(),
TimeClockEntry.entityDescription(),
```

---

## üîÅ Recent Enhancements

- Appointment creation now enforces customer selection using the same searchable picker as the check-in flow
- Scheduled appointments appear on the customer detail screen with quick access to the appointment sheet
- Staff can delete scheduled appointments directly from the detail view when a booking needs to be cleared
- Repair tickets linked to the customer are surfaced on the detail page for full service history context

These updates keep customer interactions aligned with employee workflows and reduce booking mistakes.

### 3. Update Main App

Wrap main view with authentication:

```swift
@main
struct ProTechApp: App {
    @StateObject private var authService = AuthenticationService.shared
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            if authService.isAuthenticated {
                MainContentView()
                    .environmentObject(authService)
            } else {
                LoginView()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Add Navigation Items

Add to main navigation/sidebar:

```swift
// Employee Management (Admin only)
if authService.hasPermission(.manageEmployees) {
    NavigationLink(destination: EmployeeManagementView()) {
        Label("Employees", systemImage: "person.3")
    }
}

// Time Clock (All employees)
NavigationLink(destination: TimeClockView()) {
    Label("Time Clock", systemImage: "clock.fill")
}

// Logout Button
Button(action: { authService.logout() }) {
    Label("Logout", systemImage: "rectangle.portrait.and.arrow.right")
}
```

### 5. Update Existing Features (Optional)

Link ticket time tracking to employees:

```swift
// In TimeEntry creation
if let currentEmployeeId = AuthenticationService.shared.currentEmployeeId {
    timeEntry.technicianId = currentEmployeeId
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Default Admin Account
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Change immediately in production!**

```
Email: admin@protech.com
Password: admin123
PIN: 1234
```

### Production Setup
1. Delete default admin after creating real admin
2. Require strong passwords (8+ characters)
3. Enable 2FA (future enhancement)
4. Configure session timeout appropriately
5. Regular password rotation policy

---

## üíª Usage Examples

### Creating First Employee (Admin)

```swift
let employeeService = EmployeeService()

try employeeService.createEmployee(
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Smith",
    email: "john@protech.com",
    role: .technician,
    pinCode: "5678",
    password: "secure123",
    hourlyRate: 35.00,
    phone: "555-1234"
)
```

### Checking Permissions

```swift
let authService = AuthenticationService.shared

// Check if user can manage employees
if authService.hasPermission(.manageEmployees) {
    // Show employee management UI
}

// Require permission (throws if denied)
try authService.requirePermission(.processPayments)
```

### Using Time Clock

```swift
let timeClockService = TimeClockService()

// Clock in
let entry = try timeClockService.clockIn(employeeId: employeeId)

// Start break
try timeClockService.startBreak(employeeId: employeeId)

// End break
try timeClockService.endBreak(employeeId: employeeId)

// Clock out
try timeClockService.clockOut(employeeId: employeeId, notes: "Completed 5 tickets")

// Get hours
let hours = timeClockService.getTotalHoursThisWeek(for: employeeId)
```
