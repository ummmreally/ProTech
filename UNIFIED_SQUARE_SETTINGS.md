# ✅ Fixed: Unified Square Settings Page

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Issue:** Two separate Square settings pages causing confusion  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed - Now ONE unified page

---

## The Problem

You had **TWO different Square configuration pages**:

1. **"Square POS" tab** 
   - Old settings page
   - Saved credentials in UserDefaults/memory
   - NOT connected to inventory sync

2. **"Square Integration" (hidden)**
   - New inventory sync page
   - Saves credentials in CoreData
   - What the sync manager actually uses

**Result:** You entered credentials in "Square POS" but the sync manager couldn't find them! 🤦

---

## The Fix

**Replaced "Square POS" with unified "Square" tab** that includes:

✅ **All POS/Payment Features:**
- Access Token configuration
- Location ID
- Environment selection (Sandbox/Production)
- Test Connection

✅ **Plus Inventory Sync Features:**
- Sync All Items
- Import from Square
- Export to Square
- Sync Dashboard
- Conflict Resolution
- Auto-Sync Settings
- Sync History

---

## What You Need to Do NOW

### **⚠️ Important: Re-enter Your Credentials**

Your old credentials from "Square POS" tab won't carry over. You need to enter them again in the NEW unified page:

### **Step 1: Restart ProTech**
Quit and relaunch the app to see the new unified page.

### **Step 2: Go to Settings → Square**
The tab now says just **"Square"** (not "Square POS")

### **Step 3: Enter Your Credentials**
1. Click **"Enter Square Credentials"** button
2. Paste your **same access token** you used before
3. Select **"Sandbox (Testing)"** (same as before)
4. Click **"Connect"**

### **Step 4: Verify Success**
You should see:
```
✅ Successfully connected to Square! Found X location(s).
```

AND in the console:
```
✅ Configuration loaded: Merchant XXXX, Environment: Sandbox
✅ SquareInventorySyncManager initialized with configuration
```

### **Step 5: Try Sync**
Now click **"Import from Square"** or **"Sync All Items"** - it should work!

## Why This Fixes Your Sync Error

### **Before:**
```
1. You enter token in "Square POS" tab
   ↓
2. Saved to UserDefaults (temporary)
   ↓
3. Sync manager looks in CoreData
   ↓
4. Nothing found → "notConfigured" ❌
```

### **After:**
```
1. You enter token in unified "Square" tab
   ↓
2. Saved to CoreData (persistent)
   ↓
3. Sync manager looks in CoreData
   ↓
4. Found configuration → Sync works! ✅
```

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the new Square tab"

**Solution:** Rebuild and restart the app
```bash
# In terminal
cd /Users/swiezytv/Documents/Unknown/ProTech
xcodebuild clean build -project ProTech.xcodeproj -scheme ProTech
```

Then fully quit and relaunch ProTech.

### "I still see 'Square POS' tab"

**Solution:** Hard restart
1. Quit ProTech completely (⌘Q)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Relaunch ProTech
4. Check Settings - should say just "Square"

### "Sync still fails after re-entering credentials"

**Check these:**
1. Console shows: `✅ Configuration loaded`
2. Settings shows: `✅ Connected to Square`
3. Click "Test Connection" - should succeed
4. Try "Import from Square" again
