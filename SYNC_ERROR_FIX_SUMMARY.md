# ‚úÖ Sync Error Fixed - Now Shows Clear Instructions

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Issue:** "notConfigured" errors without clear guidance  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed with helpful error messages

---

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Better Error Messages**

**Before:**
```
Sync failed: notConfigured
```

**After:**
```
‚ùå Not Connected

Please enter your Square credentials first:
1. Click 'Enter Square Credentials'
2. Paste your access token
3. Click 'Connect'

Then try syncing again.
```

### 2. **Configuration Loading on App Start**

The app now:
- ‚úÖ Loads saved Square credentials when it starts
- ‚úÖ Sets them in the API service automatically
- ‚úÖ Shows console messages to help debug
- ‚úÖ Warns if no credentials are found

**Console Output:**
```
‚úÖ Configuration loaded: Merchant ABC123, Environment: Sandbox
‚úÖ SquareInventorySyncManager initialized with configuration
```

Or if not configured:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è No configuration found - please enter Square credentials
‚ö†Ô∏è SquareInventorySyncManager initialized WITHOUT configuration
```

### 3. **Early Validation**

Sync buttons now:
- ‚úÖ Check if you're connected BEFORE trying to sync
- ‚úÖ Show helpful error popup immediately
- ‚úÖ Tell you exactly what to do next

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting "notConfigured"?

**Check these:**

1. **Did you click "Connect"?**
   - The popup has a "Connect" button - make sure you clicked it
   - Look for success message

2. **Is the token correct?**
   - Must be the full token (starts with `EAAA...`)
   - No spaces before/after
   - From the correct environment (Sandbox/Production)

3. **Restart the app?**
   - Sometimes helps to fully quit and reopen ProTech
   - Configuration should persist

4. **Check the console:**
   - Look for "‚ö†Ô∏è No configuration found"
   - If you see this, credentials didn't save

### "Failed to connect" Error?

**Most common causes:**

1. **Invalid token**
   - Copy the entire token again
   - Make sure it's not expired
   - Check environment matches (Sandbox vs Production)

2. **Network issue**
   - Check internet connection
   - Try again in a few seconds

3. **Wrong environment**
   - Using sandbox token with "Production" selected (or vice versa)
   - Match the token type to environment selection

---

## Next Steps

### **Right Now:**
1. Get your Square sandbox token (5 minutes)
2. Enter it in ProTech
3. Click "Connect"
4. Try "Import from Square"

### **After Testing:**
- If everything works with sandbox, you can switch to production
- Get production token from Square
- Disconnect sandbox
- Connect with production token
- Do initial sync
