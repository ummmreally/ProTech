## üîî How Notifications Work

### Estimate Approval Flow
1. Customer approves estimate in portal
2. `CustomerPortalService` saves approval
3. Notification posted: `.estimateApproved` with `estimateId`
4. Dashboard and Estimate List receive notification
5. Fetch estimate details from Core Data
6. Show alert with customer name and estimate number
7. Staff member acknowledges alert

### Estimate Decline Flow
1. Customer declines estimate with optional reason
2. `CustomerPortalService` saves decline and reason
3. Notification posted: `.estimateDeclined` with `estimateId` and `reason`
4. Dashboard and Estimate List receive notification
5. Fetch estimate details from Core Data
6. Show alert with customer name, estimate number, and reason
7. Staff member can read decline reason and follow up
