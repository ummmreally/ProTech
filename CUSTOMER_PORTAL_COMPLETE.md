## Integration Points

### Notifications
The portal integrates with the notification system:

```swift
// Estimate Approved
NotificationCenter.default.post(
    name: .estimateApproved,
    object: nil,
    userInfo: ["estimateId": estimate.id]
)

// Estimate Declined
NotificationCenter.default.post(
    name: .estimateDeclined,
    object: nil,
    userInfo: ["estimateId": estimate.id, "reason": reason]
)

// Portal Logout
NotificationCenter.default.post(
    name: .customerPortalLogout,
    object: nil
)
```

### Core Data Integration
The portal reads from existing entities:
- `Customer` - Customer information
- `Ticket` - Repair tickets
- `Invoice` - Invoices and line items
- `Estimate` - Estimates and line items
- `Payment` - Payment records

No new Core Data entities required!

## Code Examples

### Opening the Portal Programmatically

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var showingPortal = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("Open Customer Portal") {
            showingPortal = true
        }
        .sheet(isPresented: $showingPortal) {
            CustomerPortalLoginView()
        }
    }
}
```

### Accessing Portal from Main Menu

Add to your main navigation:

```swift
NavigationLink(destination: CustomerPortalLoginView()) {
    Label("Customer Portal", systemImage: "person.circle")
}
```

### Listening for Estimate Actions

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct AdminDashboardView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Your dashboard content
        }
        .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .estimateApproved)) { notification in
            if let estimateId = notification.userInfo?["estimateId"] as? UUID {
                // Handle estimate approval
                print("Estimate \(estimateId) was approved by customer")
            }
        }
        .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .estimateDeclined)) { notification in
            if let estimateId = notification.userInfo?["estimateId"] as? UUID,
               let reason = notification.userInfo?["reason"] as? String {
                // Handle estimate decline
                print("Estimate \(estimateId) was declined: \(reason)")
            }
        }
    }

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **Simple Lookup** - Email/phone verification
- **No Password Storage** - Reduces security overhead
- **Session-Based** - Logout clears credentials

### Future Security Enhancements

- **Two-Factor Authentication** - Optional 2FA
- **Password Protection** - Optional customer accounts
- **Session Timeouts** - Auto-logout after inactivity
- **Access Logging** - Track portal usage

---

## Troubleshooting

### Customer Can't Log In
**Problem:** "No account found" error

**Solutions:**
1. Verify email/phone matches check-in records
2. Check for typos in customer record
3. Ensure customer has at least one ticket/invoice
4. Try alternate login method (email vs phone)

### Estimates Not Showing
**Problem:** Customer doesn't see estimates

**Solutions:**
1. Verify estimate is assigned to correct customer
2. Check estimate status (should not be "converted")
3. Refresh portal (re-login)

### Portal Performance
**Problem:** Slow loading

**Solutions:**
1. Check Core Data indexes
2. Limit fetched results for large datasets
3. Implement pagination for long lists
4. Cache frequently accessed data
