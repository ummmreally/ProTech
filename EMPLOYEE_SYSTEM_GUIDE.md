## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Add Core Data Entities

Open your Xcode project and add these entities to Core Data model:

#### Employee Entity
```
Attributes:
- id: UUID (indexed)
- firstName: String
- lastName: String
- email: String (indexed, unique)
- phone: String (optional)
- role: String
- pinCode: String (optional)
- passwordHash: String (optional)
- hourlyRate: Decimal
- isActive: Boolean
- isAdmin: Boolean
- employeeNumber: String
- hireDate: Date
- lastLoginAt: Date (optional)
- profileImageData: Binary Data (optional)
- createdAt: Date
- updatedAt: Date
```

#### TimeClockEntry Entity
```
Attributes:
- id: UUID (indexed)
- employeeId: UUID (indexed)
- clockInTime: Date
- clockOutTime: Date (optional)
- breakStartTime: Date (optional)
- breakEndTime: Date (optional)
- totalBreakDuration: Double
- totalHours: Double
- notes: String (optional)
- isActive: Boolean
- createdAt: Date
- updatedAt: Date
```

### Step 2: Update CoreDataManager

Add the new entities to your Core Data stack:

```swift
// In CoreDataManager.swift, add to entity descriptions:
Employee.entityDescription(),
TimeClockEntry.entityDescription(),
```

### Step 3: Integrate with Main App

Update your main app view to show login when not authenticated:

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct ProTechApp: App {
    @StateObject private var authService = AuthenticationService.shared
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            if authService.isAuthenticated {
                MainContentView()
            } else {
                LoginView()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Add Navigation Items

Add employee-related views to your main navigation:

```swift
// In sidebar navigation
if authService.hasPermission(.manageEmployees) {
    NavigationLink(destination: EmployeeManagementView()) {
        Label("Employees", systemImage: "person.3")
    }
}

NavigationLink(destination: TimeClockView()) {
    Label("Time Clock", systemImage: "clock")
}
```

## 📊 Reports & Analytics

### Time Clock Reports

#### Individual Employee Reports
- Total hours worked (week/month/custom range)
- Break time tracking
- Attendance history
- Estimated pay calculations

#### All Employees
- Who's currently clocked in
- Total labor hours by period
- Labor cost analysis
- Payroll export (coming soon)

### Accessing Reports
```swift
// Get employee hours for date range
let hours = timeClockService.getTotalHoursForEmployee(
    employeeId,
    from: startDate,
    to: endDate
)

// Calculate pay
let pay = timeClockService.calculatePay(
    for: employeeId,
    hourlyRate: employee.hourlyRate,
    from: startDate,
    to: endDate
)
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Default Admin Account

The system automatically creates a default admin on first run:

```
Email: admin@protech.com
Password: admin123
PIN: 1234
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Change these credentials immediately in production!**

### Session Timeout

Modify timeout duration in `AuthenticationService.swift`:

```swift
private let sessionTimeoutMinutes: TimeInterval = 30 // Change as needed
```

### PIN Requirements

PIN must be 4-6 digits. Modify validation in `EmployeeService.swift`:

```swift
func isValidPIN(_ pin: String) -> Bool {
    let pinPattern = "^[0-9]{4,6}$" // Modify pattern as needed
    let pinTest = NSPredicate(format: "SELF MATCHES %@", pinPattern)
    return pinTest.evaluate(with: pin)
}
```

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Features

### Time Tracking Integration

The new employee system integrates with existing `TimeEntry` for ticket time tracking:

```swift
// Link ticket time entries to employees
TimeEntry(
    context: context,
    ticketId: ticketId,
    technicianId: currentEmployee.id, // Employee ID
    isBillable: true,
    hourlyRate: currentEmployee.hourlyRate
)
```

### Notifications & Logging

Future enhancement: Log employee actions for audit trail:
- Ticket status changes
- Payment processing
- Setting modifications
- Customer data access

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Employee already exists" error
- Email addresses must be unique
- Check if employee already exists
- Use different email address

#### "Invalid PIN" error
- PIN must be 4-6 digits only
- No letters or special characters
- Try resetting PIN

#### Clock in/out not working
- Ensure employee is logged in
- Check if already clocked in
- Verify employee is active

#### Permission denied
- Check employee role and permissions
- Only admins can manage employees
- Some features require specific roles

## 🔄 Related System Updates

While finalizing the employee platform we also tightened the link between **appointments and the customer database**:

- Scheduling now requires selecting a registered customer (no more placeholder bookings)
- The appointment form includes a searchable customer picker that matches the check-in workflow
- Customer detail pages list every linked appointment so staff can review upcoming visits at a glance
- Scheduled appointments can be deleted directly from the detail sheet when plans change
- Repairs tied to a customer now appear in the customer detail view alongside appointments

These improvements ensure service teams always know who is arriving and can manage schedules without leaving the customer record.
