## FAQs

### Do I need to configure CloudKit now?
**No!** Your app works fine without it. Configure CloudKit only when you want multi-device sync.

### Will my data be lost?
**No!** All data is stored locally. When you enable CloudKit later, it will sync existing data.

### Does my PIN system still work?
**Yes!** Employee PINs work exactly the same with or without CloudKit.

### Can I enable CloudKit later?
**Absolutely!** That's the whole point of this setup. Enable it whenever you're ready.
