## Technical Implementation

### SMS Sending Function (TicketDetailView)

```swift
private func sendSMS(message: String) {
    guard let customer = customer.first,
          let phone = customer.phone else {
        smsErrorMessage = "Customer phone number not found."
        showingSMSError = true
        return
    }
    
    Task {
        do {
            let result = try await TwilioService.shared.sendSMS(to: phone, body: message)
            await saveSMSToDatabase(result: result, customerId: customer.id)
            
            await MainActor.run {
                if let newStatus = pendingStatusChange {
                    updateStatus(newStatus)
                    pendingStatusChange = nil
                }
            }
        } catch let error as TwilioError {
            await MainActor.run {
                smsErrorMessage = error.errorDescription ?? "Unknown error"
                showingSMSError = true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Database Persistence

All sent SMS messages are automatically saved to Core Data:
- Linked to customer
- Linked to ticket
- Includes Twilio message ID for tracking
- Stores delivery status
- Timestamps for audit trail

---

## Conditional Display

SMS buttons only appear when:
1. ✅ Twilio is configured (`TwilioService.shared.isConfigured`)
2. ✅ Customer has a phone number (`customer.phone != nil`)

This prevents confusion when SMS isn't available.
